## 🎯 Objective

"Overruled!" is an interactive courtroom drama game where players step into the shoes of a lawyer, presenting arguments and examining witnesses in a fully immersive legal environment. The game features AI-powered characters, including a judge who evaluates your arguments, opposing counsel who challenges your position, and witnesses who provide dynamic testimony. Built on the Monad blockchain, all case outcomes and player achievements are permanently recorded on-chain, creating a transparent and tamper-proof legal record. This unique blend of entertainment offers players an engaging way to develop legal reasoning skills while experiencing the drama of the courtroom.
